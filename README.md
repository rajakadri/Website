# Website

This is a personal project to create a website for the company Best Alterations (with their permission). Currently a work in progress.
The goals of this project are:

1) Create a website for customers to use that displays all the information about the company Best Alterations.
2) Be able to display my skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript and any frameworks (jQuery/Bootstrap).
3) Result in a responsive and interactive website.

# Use

The folders include the most up to date HTML, CSS, and JS files that will most likely be the final product after completion. 

1) Download all HTML files into a new folder called "RootFolder".
2) Download CSS files into the same folder.
3) Download JavaScript files into the same folder.
4) Make sure to change the "APIKEY" section in the Index HTML file with your own API Key or else the Google Maps will not show.
5) To avoid using Google API, delete the portion of code and uncomment the code above that includes an embedded Google Maps iframe.
6) Download all images into the same folder. 
7) If you want to organize the images into a different folder, the "src" in any <img> tags must be changed to that file path.
8) Open the Index HTML file.
